# airbnb-react
This project is a React-based clone of the Airbnb homepage, designed to replicate its layout and functionality. The clone includes responsive components like a header, search bar, property cards, and a footer. Styling is achieved using modern CSS frameworks, and the data is dynamically rendered using a JSON file or API integration.
